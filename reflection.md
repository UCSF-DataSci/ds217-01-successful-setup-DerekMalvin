# Getting to Know You

Welcome to DS217! Please take a few minutes to introduce yourself by answering these questions. There are no right or wrong answers - we just want to get to know you better and understand what you're hoping to get from this course.

## 1. Who are you and what's your background?
[Tell us a bit about yourself - your field of study, professional background, interests, or anything else you'd like to share]
Hi, my name is Derek and I am a first year MS Health Data Science student here at UCSF. I recently graduated from UCSD in Public Health and I am originally from Oxnard, California but have also lived in Louisiana and Japan. I am interested learning languages and I am currently on my fifth language. I grew up moving around a lot so I became intrigued by languages since I was young. I am always open to connecting with people abroad and believe that language is an important bridge to building connections. 
## 2. What are you looking for out of this class?
[What do you hope to gain? Specific skills, knowledge, applications, career goals?]
I am hoping to become as fluent as possible in Python to the point where I am confident in everything I code. I understand that this is a difficult task but I am looking forward to the opportunity to learn this quarter. I hope that I can write clean code by the end of the quarter and confidently say that I can use Python. I hope to be able to utilize these skills in future job opportunites as well as in my own future endeavors. 
## 3. What are you most looking forward to or tentative about?
[What excites you about programming/data science? What concerns or uncertainties do you have?]
I am most excited about being able to work with health data and be able to organize it in a way where I can present my findings clearly. The concern/uncertainty that I have about this course will probably be my level of programming compared to others. I didn't come from a coding background so I am trying my best to keep up with the rest.
